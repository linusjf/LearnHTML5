    <h1>Spraying Techniques for Fruit Trees</h1>
    <p class="first">
      For best results, you must apply some pesticides to your fruit trees. The
      goal, of course, is to get the best fruit with the least amount of
      chemicals. This guide provides some tips and techniques for achieving this
      goal

    <h2><a href="#equipment">Equipment</a></h2>
    <p class="first">
      Unfortunately, most people lack the proper equipment. Most hobbyists have
      either a handheld tank sprayer that required pumping, or a sprayer that
      fits on the end of a hose. The pump sprayer applies chemicals accurately,
      and enables the proper mixing to be done, but the range is limited and
      upper branches may be missed. Hose-end sprayers can reach high up, but it
      is difficult to properly gauge the mix due to fluctuations in water
      pressure. The mix of water to chemical is an essential factor, so we do
      not recommend hose-end sprayers. Either use a tank sprayer (and stand on a
      ladder if needed), rent equipment, or hire a professional to do the
      spraying.
    </p>
    <h2><a href="#mixing">Mixing</a></h2>
    <p class="first">
      When mixing pesticides, make sure you follow directions exactly. Wear
      rubber gloves, and any other protective equipment recommended on the
      package. Make sure you measure accurately. Most pesticides come in
      powdered form, and require a certain number of tablespoons be mixed per
      gallon. Do not use your kitchen measuring spoons or cups; buy a separate
      set just for pesticides. Put the pesticide in the tank first, and then add
      the water. Gauge the water amount by the marks on the tank. For a host
      sprayer, set the adjustment on the sprayer for a certain amount of
      pesticide per gallon of water flow.
    </p>
    <h2><a href="#spraying">Spraying</a></h2>
    <p class="first">
      It is important to cover all surfaces uniformly, while not overspraying.
      Leaves should be wet, but not dripping. The larger the tree, the more
      difficult and time-consuming it will be to spray. Well-pruned trees are
      easier to spray than more dense ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a large tree, spray from the inside to the outside. Start with the
      trunk, and then spray the outer branches from the inside. Then spray the
      outer branches from the outside. Small trees can be sprayed on the outside
      only. On the outside, start at the top and spray downward, working your
      way around the tree. Try not to overlap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay away from the treated trees for the period of time specified on the
      pesticide packaging. This can range from 12 hours for a week. Keep your
      family and pets out of the area as well.
    </p>
    <h2><a href="#cleanup">Cleanup</a></h2>
    <p class="first">
      Clean the tank, sprayer, and all protective gear with clean water. Use
      soap on your protective gear and rinse with running water, and then allow
      them to air-dry. Change all your clothing immediately after spraying, and
      when laundering the clothes you wore while spraying, launder them
      separately from the rest of your laundry and use hot water.
